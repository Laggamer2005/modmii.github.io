<li>This guide does not require a WiFi connection on your Wii.</li>
<li>cIOS(s) required to use USB-Loaders, if you are missing cIOS(s) run the ModMii Wizard function to softmod your Wii before setting up your USB-Loader and/or external Hard-Drive.</li>
<li>After completing this guide, you can launch your USB-Loader via the Homebrew Channel or a USB-Loader forwarder channel.</li>
<!-------------------------------USB LOADER NOTES BELOW---------------------------------->
<li>Double check that your hard drive is always plugged into usb port0 - the one nearest the edge of the Wii.
<li>Not all external hard drive's are compatible with the Wii, small USB flash drives or 'thumb drives' in particular often don't work very well. For a list of which USB hard drive's are compatible, check out the <a href="https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/USB_Devices_Compatibility_List" target="_blank">USB Devices Compatibility List</a></li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>If you are determined to try using a small USB flash drive or 'thumb drive', you may have more success if running the loader off of an SD Card and formatting the flash drive as WBFS instead of FAT32. This can be done using Wii Backup Manager. However, doing so will not only restrict the drive to storing only Wii games, but will not be accessible by your PC without a program like Wii Backup Manager. In fact, every time you plug the hard drive into your PC you will be prompted to reformat it.
	</ul>
<li>If a USB Loader fails to load a particular game, try changing it's game specific settings to use a different custom IOS like 250, 251, etc. Your cIOS 249 should play the vast majority of games, for more information see the <a href="https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/Wii_cIOS_base_Compatibility_List" target="_blank">Wii cIOS base Compatibility List</a></li></li>

		</ul>
	<li>In the Disk Management window, right-click the disk you want and select "Properties".
	<li>In the disk's properties window, select the "Volumes" tab.
	<li><b>If the "Partition style" is already Master Boot Record (MBR), you can skip the rest of this step.</b>
	</ol>
<br>
<li><b>If your hard drive is larger than 2TB and not already MBR, you must follow <a href="http://tiny.cc/wiibigdrive" target="_blank">ca032769's guide</a> to complete the rest of this step.</b>
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>ca032769's guide only supports Western Digital Hard Drives.
	<li>If your hard drive is >2TB, not MBR, and not made by Western Digital you are currently out of luck.
	<li>Once you have successfully converted your hard drive to MBR you can proceed to the next step of this guide.
	</ul>
<br>
<li><b>If your hard drive is 2TB or less and not already MBR you must convert it using one of the two methods below.</b>
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Method 1: MiniTool Partition Wizard</b>
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>If you have files on the drive you want to keep, you can convert the Partition style to MBR without losing data using MiniTool Partition Wizard.
	<li>Even though your data should be preserved, there are no guarantees and you should still back up your files.
	<li>If your drive is not already in the desired format (e.g. FAT32) you will have to format it during the next step anyway so there's no point in using this method.
	</ul>

<br>
<ol type="A">
	<li><a href="http://tiny.cc/minitoolfree" target="_blank">Download MiniTool Partition Wizard</a>, install it and start the program.
	</li>
<A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_YY-FKA5GaQ?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="https://modmii.github.io/Images/gifs/MiniTool.gif" border="0"/></a><br>

	<li>Within the MiniTool window, right-click the GPT disk you want to convert and choose "Convert GPT Disk to MBR Disk".
	<li>Click the "Apply" button in the toolbar.
	<li>Click the "Yes" button to confirm conversion.
	<li>Wait for the conversion to finish then click "OK".
	<li>Once you have successfully converted your hard drive to MBR you can proceed to the next step of this guide.
</ol>

<br>

<li><b>Method 2: Windows Disk Management</b>

<ol type="A">
<li><b>Back up any data on the disk before continuing! This will wipe all data on the disk!</b>
<li>Open Disk Management following the same procedure above and locate the disk drive you want to use.

</li>
<A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nObWgTrvEMo?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="https://modmii.github.io/Images/gifs/MBR_WDM.gif" border="0"/></a><br>

<li>Right-click the partition(s) on the drive (make sure you select the right drive!) and select "Delete Volume" or "Delete Partition" to remove them. Repeat this process for each partition on that disk.

<li>Right-click the disk in Disk Management and select "Convert to MBR Disk."


<li>On the lower half menu of the window, locate the unallocated space, right-click it, and select "New Simple Volume" and click "Next".
<li>Choose a Drive letter for this partition, then click "Next".
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Make note of this drive letter, as it will be needed later.
	</ul>
<li>Set the File System to your desired format and optionally customize the "Volume label".
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If your desired format (e.g. FAT32) isn't an option choose "NTFS" and we can change it later.
	</ul>

<li>Click "Next", then click "Finish".
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you see a message indicating you need to format the drive, click "Cancel".
	</ul>
</ol>

<b><u>FAT32 + WBFS</u></b><br>

<br>
Pros:<br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>FAT32 partition can be used to launch apps without requiring an SD card.
<li>FAT32 partition is compatible with playing Gamecube games.
<li>FAT32 partition is compatible with SNEEK/Nand Emulation.
<li>WBFS has greater compatibility with hard drives, especially small thumb drives. If loading backups using other formats doesn't work you can try WBFS before getting a new hard drive.

</ul>
Cons:<br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>May not be possible with some low capacity USB flash drives.
<li>A little more work to setup.
<li>WBFS partition can ONLY store Wii Games.
<li>Windows Explorer cannot open WBFS partitions and may prompt you to format it, careful not to do so accidentally.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>Wii games saved to a WBFS partition can still be managed on your PC using Wii Backup Manager or on your Wii using a USB-Loader.

<i>Ripping <u>original</u> Wii discs cannot be done on a computer without one of the rare disc drives that are capable of doing so (most are LG branded).</i><br><br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>To copy Wii Discs, launch USB-Loader GX and insert the disc into your Wii, if you're not prompted to copy\install the game you can press <kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">+</kbd> to start making a backup.
<li>To copy GameCube (or Wii) Discs, launch "CleanRip" from the HBC and insert the disc into your Wii, then follow the very simple on-screen instructions. Note that CleanRip does not support devices formatted as WBFS.
<ul style=align="left" type="square"><li><b>Warning</b>: Using your Wii to rip games to NTFS is <u>very</u> unstable, it is highly recommended to rip games to a FAT32 or WBFS formatted HDD, then transfer them to your NTFS drive using a computer.

<!---------------------------------------Credits, apps, and sources are below---------------------------------------------->
<font size="6"><li><a name="Credits">Credits, Supporting Apps, and Sources</a></li></font><br>
ModMii was written entirely by yours truly, XFlak. Trust me, no one else is crazy enough to try to maintain a batch file that has grown so large and 'all over the place'. But without the help of many other very talented people ModMii would not exist. Some people have contributed supporting files or programs, others have shared their knowledge, some have provided ideas and others have given their time.<br>
<br>
I have tried my best to recognize everyone's contribution to ModMii regardless of how big or small it is. If I've forgotten someone, please notify me and I'll add them to the credits as quickly as possible.<br><br>

<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li><font size="4"><b>Team Twiizers</b></font><br>
Thanks to Team Twiizers for creating the revolutionary HackMii Installer. Without their hard work, the Wii might never have been unlocked. Many Team Twiizer Members went on to join Team Fail Overflow; a team that played a vital role in unlocking the PS3.<br><br>

I especially want to thank Bushing (may he rest in peace), who before his untimely passing gave ModMii his blessing to download and use the HackMii Installer.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Giantpune</font></b><br>
Giantpune is a legend in the Wii Scene and I consider him to be a good friend of mine. He created many exploits, including the Smash Stack exploit for PAL and KOR Wii's (which is maybe still the only method to fix 003 bricked Wii's), the Channel Forwarder dol, USB Loader GX, and many other computer programs to repair or virginize Wii's.<br><br>

He's contributed code to more projects than I even know about, so its impossible for me to truly convey his impact on the scene. He even took the time to explain a few things to me about cIOSs when ModMii was in its early stages and still known as NUS Auto Downloader.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">DeadlyFoez</font></b><br>
DeadlyFoez is legendary for his Wii Repairs and infectus tutorial. Anyone who's broken their Wii can email <a href="mailto:deadlyfoez@yahoo.com ">deadlyfoez@yahoo.com </a> to have it fixed.<br><br>

DeadlyFoez played a key role in the ModMii v5.0.0 update not only by helping come up with the idea for using html guides but also creating the template for ModMii's custom html guides and recording almost all of the videos and images they use. Within 1.5 weeks since our initial conversation we were able to collaborate and bring the idea to life in time to release it for Christmas. Working with him on this was a truly rewarding and fun experience. DeadlyFoez also single-handedly built the first official ModMii website.<br><br>

What can I say about THE "DeadlyFoez" on a personal level. He's always getting me into trouble but his friendship is worth every fiasco! It's unreal how he became one of my best friends. Just goes to show you not everyone you meet online is totally crazy; in his case... just a little crazy. But seriously, thanks to DeadlyFoez for always being there for me to bounce ModMii ideas off of, for hosting our Team Your Mom meetings and for introducing me to his awesome family and friends. There's no one else I'd rather geek out with and I'll always have your back.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Violator</font></b><br>
He's my bro, my cuz, my best man and the reason I ever bought or modded a Wii. "XFlak" would have died many years ago if not for him. Thanks Violator, for getting me interested in this stuff, and for all the awesome music you recorded for ModMii and my <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/x-flaks-crazy-intro-videos.189411" target="_blank">Crazy Intro Videos</a>.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">JoostinOnline</font></b><br>
Thanks for his work developing KoreanKii (with tueidj), Syscheck HD Edition, sharing his webhosting space with me, and for all his jokes; I'll never get tired of our endless patriotic "debates".</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Crediar, Daco Taco and Phpgeek</font></b><br>
The above people all had a hand in creating Priiloader. This was another revolutionary tool mainly because it was the first to offer some level of protection to newer Wii's that were unable to install Bootmii at boot2. Crediar developed the original preloader as well as s/uneek, Nintendont, NMM, DML, etc. Special thanks to Daco Taco for being the last man standing in terms of actively improving/maintaining Priiloader.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Comex</font></b><br>
In addition to being a member of Team Twiizers and contributing to the HackMii Installer, Comex created the heavily utilized bannerbomb exploit. This exploit is what allows Wii's on firmwares 3.0-4.2 to be softmodded with only an SD Card instead of needing one of a few specific Wii Games.</li><br>


<li><b><font size="4">Waninkoko</font></b><br>
Waninkoko was the first to publicly release a cIOS and other excellent apps like WAD manager, Save Game Manager, USB loader, etc. I also want to thank him for giving ModMii permission to recreate his cIOSs in WAD form.<br><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Hermes</font></b><br>
Hermes is well known for his cIOS 222/223/224 and for his usbloader "uloader". For a time his cIOSs were the only ones to work with RockBand type games and they are still highly utilized today.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">davebaol and XFlak</font></b><br>
These developers worked together to modify Waninkoko's rev21 cIOS and created a new "d2x" cIOS. This cIOS is currently considered the ultimate cIOS because it corrected many bugs and added features that were previously thought to be impossible (ie. Support for IOS Reloading Games). WiiPower was also heavily influential in achieving IOS Reload Support.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Fullmetal5</font></b><br>
Thanks for his work developing the str2hax and bluebomb exploits. Fullmetal5 may have arrived a bit late to the Wii scene, but he's probably one of the most talented developers still active in the scene today. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Rodries</font></b><br>
Thanks to Rodries for improving upon Hermes v5.1 cIOSs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiGator</font></b><br>
WiiGator created a cMIOS and Gamecube Backup Launcher. Any GameCube fans owe a big thank you to WiiGator for his work.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">cwstjdenobs</font></b><br>
cwstjdenobs is one of the few people I've encountered in the Wii scene that I would love to treat to a beer. He was always very supportive of me and encouraged me to ask him as many questions as I'd like. He is probably most well known for YAWMM (Yet Another Wad Manager Mod) which was the first Wad Manager to add brick protection by restricting users from making silly mistakes like uninstalling or stubbing a crucial file. He's also made and modified apps specifically for ModMii. For example, he modified WadMii so it doesn't timestamp WADs and he also made a setting.txt builder for ModMii's NAND builder.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Leathl</font></b><br>
Leathl is another awesome developer who supported me before I became well known by expanding upon his apps to further support ModMii. Leathl has created many Wii apps including ShowMiiWads, CustomizeMii, libWiiSharp, patchios, nusfilegrabber, etc. Despite his recent inactivity, his apps are still highly used today... just goes to show you that quality work never gets old. I also want to thank RetroHead for him Mod of ShowMiiWads which ModMii uses to build emulated nands without requiring any input from the user. libWiiSharp.dll is based on wii.py, the wii.py devs are Megazig, Omega, Xuzz, SquidMan, Matt_P and The Lemon Man. Also thanks to Daeken for writing Struct.py and marcan for his LZ77 code.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">scooby74029</font></b><br>
scooby74029's most well known for sneeky compiler, which is able to build multiple different versions of s\uneek. ModMii will always construct the latest version of s\uneek available on his sneeky compiler google code webpage. This means he has total control over what version of s\uneek ModMii will construct. He also created modifications of Leathl's libWiiSharp.dll and patchios.exe to further support ModMii. Additionally, he's modified other apps like Any Region Changer ModMii Edition, JoyFlow, JoyLoader GX, JoyLoader CFG, etc. On top of all that, he's an all around awesome person and I'm proud to be on his friends list.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">person66</font></b><br>
person66 has had a hand in many projects, but most noteworthy are his sharpii cmd line tool and his Universal Forwarder Creator. He also wrote an autoit script that is used to launch ModMii with an icon, arguments and other useful functions.<br><br>
Thanks for trading little bits of batch coding knowledge with me. It's great having a fellow batch coder for a friend; we are a dying breed, so keep up the great work with Universal Forwarder Creator and all your other projects.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiPower</font></b><br>
WiiPower created Neogamma, hands down the best backup disc loader for the Wii. He also modified WiiGators cMIOS and created what is today considered the ultimate cMIOS. Furthermore he's contributed code to many other popular usb-loaders and had a hand in adding IOS Reloading support to the d2x cIOSs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">OverjoY and obcd</font></b><br>
OverjoY created JoyFlow, a modification of WiiFlow that runs on s\uneek. He then teamed up with obcd to accomplish some seriously amazing things, like building their mod of s\uneek, NEEK2O, that allows it to load games in wbfs format and select from multiple emulated NANDs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Arikado and the Dop-Mii Team</font></b><br>
They created Dop-Mii; a lot of apps borrow code from Dop-Mii, so even if you have never used Dop-Mii but used MMM or WiiMod then you owe a thank you to these people.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiWu</font></b><br>
He made Multi-Mod Manager (MMM) which has the functions of many different Wii modding tools all in one user friendly app.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WB3000 and WiiNinja</font></b><br>
Thanks to WB3000 for creating NUS Downloader and to WiiNinja for making a cmd line version of NUS Downloader. NUS Downloader is one of ModMii's vital supporting apps.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">TheShadowEevee</font></b><br>
TheShadowEevee helped update many tools with a new NUS endpoint. He also helped implement some fixes and improvements to Any Region Changer ModMii Edition.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiCrazy</font></b><br>
WiiCrazy is most famous for "Wii Game Shortcut Creator" (formerly known as "Crap"), Crazy Intro and Crazy Intro Video. He also contributed to usb-loaders by bypassing some game specific security. WiiCrazy is another person who's always been willing to do everything in his power to help me, or anyone else for that matter.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">oggzee, usptactical, gannon and Dr.Clipper</font></b><br>
Together the above people compose the Configurable USB Loader Team. Back in the day, this usb-loader was always the first to add new features and in my opinion it's one of the top three best usb-loader out there.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Cyan, dimok, blackb0x and the USBLoaderGX team</font></b><br>
Thanks for their work on USBLoaderGX. It is one of the most feature-rich usb-loaders and has quickly become a favourite among the community. I also want to thank Cyan specifically for his excellent support of users on gbatemp for many years; he has probably explained what an IOS is more times than I can count!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">OverjoY, blackb0x, Peter0x44 and scooby74029</font></b><br>
This dream team of developers brought my vision to life when they created YAWM ModMii Edition.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Hibernatus, Fledge68 and the WiiFlow team</font></b><br>
Thanks for their work on WiiFlow. It was always beautiful, but now it's got all sorts of bells and whistles, you should check it out.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Wiimm</font></b><br>
For Wiimmfi Thanks to Wiimm for creating Wiimmfi and Wiimms ISO Tools, including wit.exe which ModMii uses to convert Wii Games to s/uneek format as well as build forwarder ISOs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Leseratte</font></b><br>
For his work on Wiimmfi, as well as d2xl and other amazing projects.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">diddy81 and symular syn of the Wii Theme Team</font></b><br>
The Wii Theme Team has created some of the best Wii Themes ever made! All of the alternative themes available in ModMii were created by them. I want to thank diddy81 in particular for working with me to ensure that all his themes worked perfectly for all regions.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">FIX94, Narolez and the WiiXplorer Team</font></b><br>
Thanks to all these people for their contributions in making the best SD/USB forwarder. I want to thank FIX94 in particular who not only worked on Nintendont, Some YAWMM Mod, WiiFlow and literally every other big Wii application, but he also spent a lot of time testing ModMii's Forwarder Builder.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">jskyboo</font></b><br>
Thanks to jskyboo for creating WiiMod. His app can do a lot of different things, and it was the first ahbprot enabled WAD Manager to incorporate davebaol's ahbprot bugfix.</li><br>


<li><b><font size="4">ModMii's Translators</font></b><br>
Tranlating ModMii is an enormous amount of work. It's very challenging to get special characters to display correctly in a cmd window, not to mention keeping everything formatted properly. But probably the most difficult part of translating ModMii is keeping up with the updates. If you use a translated version of ModMii, I encourage you to thank your translator because it truly is a LOT of work to do.<br><br>

French Translators: <b>mamule, xav91 and ketufe</b><br>
Dutch Translator: <b>Hielkenator</b><br>
Italian Translators: <b>Wasabi, Step and Robilyn</b><br>
Spanish Translators: <b>ledebene and Burton</b></li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Fig2k4</font></b><br>
Thanks Fig2k4 for WiiBackupManager. It was a pleasure beta testing it for you and sharing my ideas with you. I hope to see you around the forums again and that you continue working on your amazing program.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Gabubu, sthetix, Foxlet, Alexander1970 and Vila</font></b><br>
Thanks for recording, editing or upscaling many of the Youtube videos used by ModMii. Special thanks to Gabubu who single-handedly created all the new\updated videos in the 7.0.0 update, and also updated GFX for a bunch of ModMii's Wii channels.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiShizzza, pepxl, RobGee789, M3RK and AuroraNemoia</font></b><br>
Thanks to WiiShizzza for creating ModMii's new icon and to pepxl for creating ModMii's original icon. I want to thank everyone who created a ModMii icon and submitted it into ModMii's new icon competition. <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/new-modmii-icon-logo-candidates.296772/" target="_blank">https://gbatemp.net/threads/new-modmii-icon-logo-candidates.296772/</a><br><br>

RobGee789 and M3RK made ModMii Skin's original graphics. AuroraNemoia made ModMii Skin's new (2022) default\Nebula theme. It was a pleasure working with them, they were all very open to feedback and willing to "go back to the drawing board", so to speak, as many times as it took to get it perfect. Thanks guys!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">dhtdht020</font></b><br>
Thanks for maintaining oscwii.org and for refreshing the ModMii icons in 2022; now I have a rainbow of icons to choose from should the need arise.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">My Fellow Guide Writers</font></b><br>
Thanks to tj_cool, xzxero, burritoboy9984, ChokeD and mauifrog for their awesome guides. I especially want to thank tj_cool and xzxero for inviting me to join "The Crew" at the Complete Softmod Guide. I'll never forget how great it felt to be relatively new to the scene and to be invited to join you all as equals.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">RiiConnect24 and Wii.Guide team</font></b><br>
Thanks in particular go out to Peter0x44, Larsenv and KcrPL. Brainstorming and collaborating with you guys made the 2020 lockdowns feel somewhat bearable. Special thanks to Peter0x44 for helping me set up the ModMii discord server to a much higher standard than I could have ever hoped to do on my own.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">DaMysteryMan</font></b><br>
Thanks for helping me understand the structure of a cIOS so I could better recreate it in WAD form. For those of you who don't know him, DaMysteryMan is most well known for his ever controversial app - DarkCorp (formerly known as cIOSCorp).</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Gannon</font></b><br>
Thanks to Gannon for bootopera, which I was able to mod to create the URL loader base dol.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Devnol</font></b><br>
Thanks to Devnol for properly modifying the Open HBC to use the same title ID as the official HBC (LULZ).</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">ca032769</font></b><br>
ca032769 is best known for his tutorial on how to use a larger than 2TB Hard Drive on a Wii as a Single FAT32 Partition, thanks!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">All My Beta Testers!</font></b><br>
It's because of you guys that ModMii is as stable as it is. Considering that ModMii is developed entirely in notepad without any kind of debugger or developer tools; it's pretty remarkable that ModMii has always been bug-free (albeit with a couple minor exceptions). Thanks for your never-ending devotion to quality control!<br>

Here's a list of some of ModMii's beta testers (in no particular order): scooby74029, DeadlyFoez, redia, Etheboss, JoostinOnline, person66, brausm08, geovalley, undeadsquirrel, mauifrog, FIX94, wolf, Larsenv, Peter0x44, Alexander1970, Cyan, Damaj301damaj, Function, forseenink, jeannotte, saulfabreg, Vila, ca032769, godreborn, KleinesSinchen, RunningSnakes, Scooty and last but certainly not least, Clutz450. @Clutz450, you're the man, I really enjoyed your ModMii tutorial videos and hearing your ideas on the little ways ModMii could be made even better.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">You!</font></b><br>
Without you, there would be no reason for ModMii to exist. Thanks for using ModMii for all your Wii softmodding needs!</li>

ModMii started out as a small side-project back in 2010 as a simple NUS Auto Downloader script, and now the changelog is taller than me! I started this project in my 20s in my spare time and since then I've gotten married and had not 1, not 2, not 3, but FOUR boys, all ~2 years apart. I love being able to share my love for gaming and for the Wii with them, and with all of you! This is a passion project that has easily taken over 8000-9000 hours of just my time alone, and that's not counting all the hours spent from the legions of devs and testers who've supported ModMii over the years.<br>
<br>
Not knowing that much about computers other than some excel tricks, I slowly built more advanced features on top of my original less efficient code that I'd love to rewrite if it wasn't such a daunting task. Throughout the journey I learned a lot from not just those in the credits list, but the incredibly supportive Wii community as a whole. I've gone from just being a "numbers guy" to my family's go to "tech guy", and I have this project, community and followers to thank for it.<br>
<br>
